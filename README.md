# FrenzyCompass - An Affordable Travel Guide 

The Frenzy Compass – An Affordable Travel Guide is a software that will help students efficiently plan their day out by suggesting them nearby activities, restaurants, and essential services based on their budget and locality when they are new to a city.

Location-Based Recommendations : Suggest nearby places (restaurants , events, grocery).​
Budget & Preference Filters : Allow filtering based on budget and activity type.​
Travel Time Optimization : Use Google Maps API to recommend the shortest travel routes.

To build this software we utilize several Google Maps APIs and Ticketmaster API to enhance student experience: 

Google Maps API: Powers interactive maps for location viewing and route planning. 
JavaScript Map API: Embeds dynamic maps on the web interface for user interaction. 
Geocoding API: Converts addresses into geographic coordinates for precise location search. 
Places API: Finds nearby places like restaurants and grocery, filtered by user preferences. 
Geolocation API: Detects the user's current location for personalized recommendations. 
Ticketmaster API: The Ticketmaster Discovery API allows you to search for events, attractions, or venues.​
